==========

The goal for pri·or·i·tize is to make prioritizing tasks easier

Stable builds will be frequently uploaded to http://prioritize.meat-software.org

### CONCEPT   ####
- The goal for pri·or·i·tize is to make prioritizing tasks easier
- Tasks are taking form as colored sticky notes
- Colors representing the difficulty or priority of the subject
- The application will use the following four (pastel) colors
    - green ---> #b6d884
    - yellow --> #fff68f
    - organge -> #f8a792
    - pink ----> #ea91bd

---------------------------------

### FUNCTIONS  ####
- PEOPLE ARE be able to:
    - Reposition tasks by Drag'n'Dropping
    - Dynamically add new tasks
    - Shortcuts:
        - Double-click-edit
- PEOPLE WILL be able to:
	- Create users && login with Facebook/Google
		- Users WILL be able to:

            		- (notes get deleted on page refresh!)
			- Create groups
			- Change between fonts
			- Share their tasks
	- Read about MY way of sorting tasks though pri·or·i·tize
	    - (this will be based on documented research and personal opinion)
- I will MAYBE be able to:
	- get suggestions from people on jakob.sturluson@gmail.com
	- get issues reported though "Issues" tab

---------------------------------

### EXPLAINATION ##
- Initial sorting of stickies
	All future sorting function will be column based, since it makes no sense
	to sort by rows seen in the aspect of screen-resolutions. It's easy to get
	an overview of where each priority-group is placed.
	- As it is right now, stickies get sorted by color/priority.
		Using this way of sorting lower priority tasks such as green and yellow,
		has 2 col's each where orange and pink has 1 each. The reason for this is that
		there has always been - in my case - more low priority tasks than high.
